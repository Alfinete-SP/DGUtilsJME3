    There was an interesting story once of a man who went for a walk with his dog.
    He took his dog to the park and there he found a note on one of the park benches.
    He took a look at the note and, funnily enough, it was addressed to him.
    Who could have written this note to me, he thought ... some one must be stalking me and I don't know it.
    
    The story continues ....
